<a id="what"></a>
##### What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static website and blog builder. It is written in Ruby, and allows a developer 
to serve static files as a website. It can be hosted on multiple services, including Heroku,
Amazon, GitHub, and even Dropbox. In effect, any HTTP server capable of serving files can run
an entire Jekyll website.

##### Benefits of Jekyll
Jekyll is also able to support high performance for its sites. This is one of the many benefits 
of serving static websites.

Websites powered by Jekyll are also inherently secure. They are considerably harder to compromise than
comparative Wordpress sites, another benefit of their static nature.

However, a potential weakness may lie in the FTP requirments. These can, however, be mitigated depending 
upon your server setup and access.

##### Target audience for Jekyll
Some degree of experience and technical ability is naturally required to develop and implement Jekyll
powered websites and resources. However, such perceived complication, if any, is more than outweighed 
by its inherent power and flexibility compared to competitors.

For example, it is far simpler to add custom layouts to a Jekyll powered website than a comparative 
Wordpress site.
